## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Calculator buttons are handled using **event listeners**.
2. User input is dynamically appended to the display.
3. Special buttons (`AC`, `DEL`, `=`) are handled with conditional logic.
4. Keyboard events are captured using `keydown`.
5. Mathematical expressions are evaluated dynamically.

## ⚠️ Note on `eval()`

This project uses `eval()` for simplicity and learning purposes.

For production-level applications, consider:
- Custom expression parsing
- Manual operator handling
- Math libraries (e.g., math.js)

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

- DOM manipulation
- Event handling (mouse & keyboard)
- Debugging DOM-related issues
- Clean UI design with CSS
- Real-world calculator logic
